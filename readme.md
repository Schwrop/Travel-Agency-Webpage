## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Schwrop/Travel-Agency-Webpage.git
```

Open `index.html` in your browser with a local web server. E.g. via the Live Server extension in VS Code editor.

Live Server is a VS Code extension that:

1. Starts a local web server on your computer.

2. Serves your HTML, CSS, and JS files through a URL (like http://127.0.0.1:5500).

3. Automatically reloads the browser whenever you save your file.

## Folder Structure

- `index.html`, `destinations.html`, `contact.html`, etc.
- `css/` — Stylesheets for each page and component
- `images/` — Destination and header images
- `icons/` — SVG icons for navigation and UI
